# Dropdown Navigation

## Add word by word and check

## Zero-Indexed from Input Field
- Input field = position 0  
- First `ArrowDown` = first dropdown option
- Second `ArrowDown` = second dropdown option

## Always Select Most Similar Option
Don't pick first available - choose closest match to requirement.
